date
day
EB operation time: Time duration for which EB_Watts(103+105) > 100
Missing hours per day : 101 register data missing for more than threshold hours
EB Wh: AUC for EB_Watts (103+105) for the entire day
EB Wh (ignition based): ifelse (boundary_flag, EB Wh, Total AC Wh - DG Wh (ignition based) - Projected EB Wh - Projected DG Wh)
Projected EB run hours: Missing hours per day - Projected DG run hours - AC < 100 hours
Projected EB Wh: Missing hours per day * Median AC_Watts during missing duration on rest of the days
Total interpolated EB Wh: EB Wh (ignition based)+ Projected EB Wh
DG operation time: Time duration for which DG_Watts(107) > 100
DG Ignition time: Event based DG run duration
DG hours diff: DG operation time - DG Ignition time
DG Wh: AUC for DG_Watts (107) for the entire day
DG Wh (ignition based): Sum of AUCs for DG_Watts (107) within ignition duration
Projected DG run hours: ifelse(DG hours diff < -0.2, DG hours diff, 0)
Projected DG Wh: Projected DG run hours * Median AC_Watts during missing duration on rest of the days
Total interpolated DG Wh: DG Wh (igniton based) + Projected DG Wh
Battery Charging time: Time duration for which ibattTOT>20
Battery Charging (Watts and DCV): Time duration for which DCV<51 and AC_Watts>3000
Battery Discharging time: Time duration for which ibattTOT<-20
Battery Discharging (Watts and DCV): Time duratin for which DCV<51 and AC_Watts<4000
AC Zero Hours: Time duration for which AC_Watts(101)=0
AC < 100 Hours: Time duration for which AC_Watts(101)<100 
Total AC Wh: AUC for AC_Watts(101) for the entire day
Total AC Wh Interpolated: EB Wh + DG Wh (igniton based) + Projected EB Wh + Projected DG Wh
